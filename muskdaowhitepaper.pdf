(1) Quantitative Investment Strategy
We are committed to the blockchain and cryptocurrency market which is very complex, with both returns and risks, and huge volatility, making it difficult for ordinary investors to obtain excess returns in the market through individual capabilities.
 
 
Over the past few years, the Musk project team has accumulated rich asset management experience, and Muskquant has resources and experience collaborating with a trading strategy and technical team of over a hundred people. The team members come from all over the world, all from traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges, with very rich financial market trading experience.
Muskquant has a complete set of automated trading systems, from quantitative strategy research, historical backtesting, live trading, to risk control. The trading platform developed by the Muskquant technical team has been tested in the market for many years, with stable and efficient operation.
Muskquant has a well-established trading strategy system,from trend-following strategy trading to hedging arbitrage trading.
Different strategies have performed well in different market periods and can also meet different investor risk preferences, thereby obtaining different expected returns.
 
 
 
 
The client can entrust their cryptocurrency to be held by Muskquant platform, supported by a professional team for trading. The Muskquant intelligent (AI) quantitative trading system dynamically manages decision-making processes through autonomous strategies and strategy combinations. The AI quantitative robot runs 24 hours fully automatically on cloud servers, with uninterrupted power and internet connectivity. With our homophobic encryption technology, anonymous transaction protection, sporadic peer-to-peer encrypted storage, and GSIOP, we can effectively ensure that our clients' funds are not subject to any damage.
 
(2) 价值投资策略
除了量化投资，我们还对优质的nft和主流数字货币进行长期或者短期投资，通过优化投资标的来实现资产增值。持有比特币或者一些主流币价格作为市值基础的投资基金，通过设立加密货币基金的方式，为Musk投资者提供了一种合法买卖加密货币的渠道。
设立Muskdao基金，为投资者提供了一种合法买卖加密货币的渠道，投资者在基金存续期间内不可以自由地买卖和赎回。在Musk基金买入相应币种后，投入到市场的基金份额在售出后需要锁仓，通过长期优化组合，来实现对用户资产的增值，而musk Dao利润来源为收取的管理费和超预期的利润分成。
(2) Value investing strategy
In addition to quantitative investing, we also engage in long-term or short-term investments in high-quality NFTs and mainstream cryptocurrencies, optimizing investment targets to achieve asset appreciation. By holding investment funds whose prices are based on the market value of Bitcoin or some mainstream coins, we have established a legitimate channel for Musk investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through the establishment of cryptocurrency funds.
The establishment of the Musk Dao fund provides investors with a legitimate channel for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, but investors cannot freely buy, sell, or redeem during the fund's tenure. After purchasing the corresponding currency in the Musk fund, the fund shares put into the market need to be locked up. Through long-term optimization of the portfolio, we aim to achieve asset appreciation for our users, with profits for Musk Dao coming from management fees and profit sharing above expectations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Musk DAO国库Musk DAO Treasury

Ecological construction holds 100 million tokens, accounting for 10% of the total supply.
 
 
Musk DAO Cross-Chain Asset Bridge：
  Musk DAO利用 L1、L2 之间的通信能力，无须信任的将任意形式的以太坊资产（包括 Ether、ERC20、ERC721 等）在 L1、L2 之间转移。当将资产从 L1 转入 L2 时，资产被存入一个 L1 上的 Musk DAO桥合约中，之后一笔相同数量的资产在 L2 上被铸造并存入指定地址；而将资产从 L2 转回 L1 时，资产将在 L2 上被销毁，随后等量的资产将在 L1 的桥合约中变为可用。
L1 向 L2 发起的交易首先被存入 inbox 中，并附带 calldata、callvalue、gas info 等交易参数。当这笔交易首次执行失败后，它将被放入 L2 的「重试缓冲区（retry buffer）」中，这意味着在一段时间内（通常为一个挑战期，即大约一周），任何人都可以通过重新执行这笔交易来赎回票据。L2 至 L1 的重试交易没有时间限制，争议期结束后的任何时间点都可进行。
这种机制设计主要是为了应对这样的场景：当某个用户希望将某笔 token 从 L1 存入 L2，首先会将这些 token 存入 L1 的桥合约中，同时在 L2 上铸造等量的 token。假设 L1 上的交易已经完成，但是 L2 上的交易却因为手续费不足失败了，这会导致一个严重问题：用户在 L1 上的 token 已经转出，但是在 L2 上却没收到 token，实际上，这些 token 被锁在了 L1 的合约里。通过可重试票据机制，用户（或者其他任何人），可以在一周内，使用足够的手续费重新执行这笔交易，并最终在 L2 上获得 token。
 
Musk Dao utilizes the communication ability between L1 and L2 to trustlessly transfer any form of Ethereum assets (including Ether, ERC20, ERC721, etc.) between L1 and L2.
When assets are transferred from L1 to L2, the assets are deposited into a Musk Dao bridge contract on L1, and then an equal amount of assets are minted on L2 and deposited into the specified address.
When assets are transferred from L2 back to L1, the assets are burned on L2, and then an equal amount of assets become available on the bridge contract on L1.
Transactions initiated from L1 to L2 are first stored in the inbox and come with transaction parameters such as calldata, callvalue, gas info, etc.
If the transaction fails to execute for the first time, it will be placed in the "retry buffer" on L2, which means that for a certain period (usually a challenge period, approximately one week), anyone can redeem the ticket by re-executing the transaction.
There is no time limit for retry transactions from L2 to L1, and they can be performed at any time after the dispute period ends.
This mechanism is designed primarily to address a scenario where a user wants to transfer a token from L1 to L2. The user would first deposit these tokens into the bridge contract on L1, while an equal amount of tokens are minted on L2.
Suppose the transaction on L1 has already been completed, but the transaction on L2 has failed due to insufficient gas fees. This would cause a serious problem: the user's tokens have been transferred out of L1, but have not been received on L2, and in fact, these tokens are locked in the contract on L1.
Through the retryable ticket mechanism, users (or anyone else) can re-execute the transaction with sufficient gas fees within a week, and ultimately receive the tokens on L2.
 
 
 
 
From L1 To L2 
用户从 L1 发起 Deposit 交易
资产存入 L1 合约，交易被批量存入 Inbox 中
交易在 L2 被执行，铸造资产转入指定地址
如果交易失败，则交易被存入 L2 的重试缓冲区，
用户可以在一个挑战期内发起重试.
From L2 To L1
用户在 L2 发起 Withdraw 交易
L2 链将在一定时间内收集到的交易打包，生成默克尔树，并将根节点作为 OutboxEntry 发布到 L1 的 Outbox 中
用户或者任何人可以对根节点和交易信息进行默克尔验证
挑战期结束后，用户即可在 L1 完成交易，如果交易失败，则用户可以发起重试
 
From L1 To L2 
A user initiates a Deposit transaction from L1.
The asset is deposited into the L1 contract, and the transaction is batched into the Inbox.
The transaction is executed on L2, and the asset is minted and transferred to the specified address.
If the transaction fails, it is stored in L2's retry buffer, and the user can initiate a retry within a challenge period.
 
 
From L2 To L1
When a user initiates a Withdraw transaction on L2,。the L2 chain will package the collected transactions within a certain time period, generate a Merkle tree, and publish the root node as an Outbox-entry to the Outbox on L1. Anyone, including the user, can verify the root node and transaction information through Merkle verification. After the challenge period ends, the user can complete the transaction on L1. If the transaction fails, the user can initiate a retry.

NFT的设计理念The design philosophy of NFT：
Albert 51949年，人类开始了将猴子送上太空的计划。此项计划由美国主导，前后一共有5只猴子参与任务（搭乘航天器名为Albert），然而因为种种原因，它们在任务中都没成功存活了下来。但它们的牺牲为人类航空事业做出了重要贡献。今天，为了纪念这5只“太空猴”，Musk DAO将首发NFT系列制作为5只“Albert”猴子，为纪念它们为人类做出的贡献，同时也会在Musk DAO社区中举办投票等线下活动，以及线上对航天事业的捐赠等。Albert 5将是Musk DAO首发的Crypto原生 IP。太空猴对人类太空事业做出的贡献对整个世界都产生着巨大的影响，由它所衍生和发行的NFT必将成为新一代潮流文化不可忽视的浪潮。而也正是因此，Albert 5也将不仅仅是一个动物形象，更是会成为了一面旗帜，被人们赋予了更深刻的意义。
我们喜欢在区块链领域创造产品，不断试验并将人们喜欢使用的应用程序变为现实。感谢您的所有支持以及与我们一起前行。
 
 
 
Albert 5：In 1949, humans began a plan to send monkeys into space. This plan was led by the United States and a total of 5 monkeys participated in the mission (riding a spacecraft named Albert), but for various reasons, none of them survived the mission. However, their sacrifice made an important contribution to human aerospace. Today, to commemorate these 5 "space monkeys", Musk Dao will launch a series of NFTs featuring the 5 "Albert" monkeys. In order to commemorate their contribution to human space exploration, Musk Dao will also hold offline events such as voting and online donations to the aerospace industry in the Musk Dao community. Albert 5 will be the first Crypto-native IP launched by Musk Dao. The contribution of space monkeys to human space exploration has had a huge impact on the world, and the NFTs derived and issued from it will undoubtedly become an unstoppable trend in the new generation of pop culture. Therefore, Albert 5 will not only be an animal image, but also a banner that people will give deeper meaning to.
 
We like to create products in the blockchain field, constantly experiment and turn applications that people love to use into reality. Thank you for all your support and for moving forward with us.

5.Trading
同态加密技术Homomorphic Encryption Technology
顾名思义，同态加密是一种加密的形式。在不对称情形下，它可以接受完全可读的文本，然后基于“公钥”将其转变为乱码。更重要的是，它可以基于“私钥”将乱码转回同样的文本。理论上，除非你有“私钥”，你无法解码加密后的乱码。同态加密是一种特殊形式的加密。它允许某人在无法阅读信息的前提下以特定的方式修改加密信息。例如，同态加密可以应用于数字上，让加密过的数字可以进行乘法和加法运算而无需解密数字。Musk DAO中大量使用同态加密技术来保证数据的隐私性和可计算性。
As the name suggests, homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption. In the asymmetric case, it can take completely readable text and turn it into gibberish based on a "public key". More importantly, it can turn the gibberish back into the same text based on a "private key". In theory, you cannot decode the encrypted gibberish unless you have the "private key". Homomorphic encryption is a special form of encryption that allows someone to modify encrypted information in a specific way without being able to read the information. For example, homomorphic encryption can be applied to numbers, allowing encrypted numbers to be multiplied and added without decrypting the numbers. Homomorphic encryption is widely used in Musk DAO to ensure the privacy and computability of data.
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
匿名交易保护Anonymous transaction protection：
匿名交易与隐私保护是电子货币的重要属性。目前大部分区块链对隐私保护的解决思路是，通过隔断交易地址和地址持有人真实身份的关联，来达到匿名的效果。所以虽然能够看到每一笔转账记录的发送方和接受方的地址，但无法对应到现实世界中的具体某个人。但这样的保护是很弱的，通过观察和跟踪区块链的信息，通过地址 ID、IP 信息并运用大数据分析总能得出跟用户相关的某些信息等。Musk DAO 从交易的无关联性和不可追踪性两个方面确保对交易信息匿名保护，并不断迭代改进匿名保护能力。Musk DAO 对交易无关联性（Unlinkability）和不可追踪性（Untraceablility）进行了规范化的定义，无关联性是指对于任何两个外部交易，不能证明将其发送给同一个人，不可追踪性是指对于每个内部交易，所有可能的发件人从概率上是相等的。无关联性和不可追踪性是强隐私保护的区块链必须满足的属性，Musk DAO 通过采用一次密钥（one-time secret key） 和环签名（ ring signature）技术来实现对无关联性和不可追踪性的支持。同时，Musk DAO设计并实现严格的零知识证明（zero-knowledge proof ）模型作为可选择功能，可进一步增强交易匿名性。
Anonymous transactions and privacy protection are important features of electronic currencies. Currently, most blockchains use the approach of separating the transaction addresses from the real identity of the address holder to achieve anonymity. Although the sender and receiver addresses of each transfer record can be seen, they cannot be traced to a specific person in the real world. However, this protection is weak, and by observing and tracking the information on the blockchain, it is always possible to obtain certain information related to users through address IDs, IP information, and big data analysis. Musk DAO ensures anonymous protection of transaction information from two aspects: unlinkability and untraceability, and iteratively improves its anonymous protection capabilities. Musk DAO has standardized the definitions of unlinkability and untraceability. Unlinkability means that for any two external transactions, it cannot be proven that they were sent to the same person. Untraceability means that for each internal transaction, all possible senders have equal probabilities. Unlinkability and Untraceability are properties that a blockchain must satisfy for strong privacy protection. Musk DAO achieves support for unlinkability and untraceability by adopting one-time secret key and ring signature technologies. Meanwhile, Musk DAO also designs and implements a strict zero-knowledge proof model as an optional feature to further enhance transaction anonymity.
 
 
 
SPOR点对点加密存储SPOR peer-to-peer encrypted storage
Musk DAO需要构建一个可以加密分享的数据存储平台，那么首先我们需要保证的是加密分享的文件本身是可以被证明存储完整性的，而不是存储后无法找回。基于这样的选择，我们需要一个可靠有效的办法去验证文件存储完整性，及其能被完整取回的相关证明。Musk DAO在这里选择的是具有代表性的 SPOR（Sentinel Proof of Retrievability）算法，该算法提供了一套完备的，可证明安全的，文件存储完整性验证的理论体系。我们可以使用这套存储完整性验证算法为之后即将介绍的Musk DAO样式共识算法提供重要的辅助信息，达到有机融合，优势互补。这部分辅助信息在之后我们做链上治理中提供了对应的权重，也就是说我们的治理并不是简单押注和线下的治理方式。我们是通过存储完整性验证算法，去审计链上存储节点的贡献，并结合押注的线上治理方式，来逐步优化并维持系统的稳定性。这种方式的优势在于其不会受一些不确定因素对系统的稳定性产生干扰。SPOR是传统 POR 的一种算法，通过设立特定的文件指纹（Sentinel）来侦测数据可验证性。文件指纹是一个随机值的区块，并且通过加密使其与文件区块无法区分(indistinguishable)。
Musk Dao needs to build a data storage platform that can encrypt and share files. The first thing we need to ensure is that the encrypted and shared files can be proven to have integrity and can be retrieved in their entirety, rather than being lost after storage. Based on this choice, we need a reliable and effective way to verify the integrity of the stored files and provide related proofs that they can be retrieved in their entirety. Musk Dao has chosen the representative SPOR (Sentinel Proof of Retrievability) algorithm, which provides a complete, provably secure theoretical system for verifying file storage integrity. We can use this set of storage integrity verification algorithms to provide important auxiliary information for the Musk Dao-style consensus algorithm that will be introduced later, achieving organic integration and complementary advantages. This auxiliary information will provide corresponding weights in our on-chain governance, which means that our governance is not simply based on staking and offline governance. We use storage integrity verification algorithms to audit the contribution of on-chain storage nodes, and combine online staking governance to gradually optimize and maintain system stability. The advantage of this approach is that it will not be affected by uncertain factors that may interfere with the stability of the system. SPOR is a type of algorithm for traditional POR, which detects the verifiability of data by setting specific file fingerprints (Sentinels). The file fingerprint is a random value block that is encrypted to be indistinguishable from the file block.

9. Warning
风险提示Risk Warning：
在Musk DAO项目的开发、维护和运营过程中存在着各种风险，这其中很多都超出了Musk DAO开发者所能控制的范围。除本白皮书所述的其他内容外，请参与者充分知晓并同意接受了下述风险There are various risks in the development, maintenance, and operation of the Musk Dao project, many of which are beyond the control of the Musk Dao developers. In addition to other contents described in this white paper, participants are fully aware and agree to accept the following risks：
 
市场风险Market Risk：Token价格与整个数字货币市场形势密不可分，如市场行情整体低靡或存在其他不可控因素的影响，则可能造成Token本身即使具备良好的前景，但价格依然长期处于被低估的状态。监管风险：由于区块链的发展尚处早期，在全球没有有关募集过程中的前置要求、交易要求、信息披露要求、锁定要求等相关的法规文件。并且目前政策会如何实施尚不明朗，这些因素均可能对项目的发展与流动性产生不确定影响。区块链技术已经成为世界上各个主要国家的监管主要对象，如果监管主体插手或施加影响则Musk DAO可能受到其影响，例如法令限制使用，Musk DAO有可能受到限制、阻碍甚至直接终止Musk DAO应用和发展。
Token price is closely related to the overall situation of the digital currency market. If the market is generally sluggish or affected by other uncontrollable factors, the token may still be undervalued for a long time, even if it has a good prospect. Regulatory risk: Due to the early stage of blockchain development, there are no relevant regulatory documents on the requirements for the fundraising process, transaction requirements, information disclosure requirements, lock-up requirements, etc. in the world. Moreover, it is unclear how policies will be implemented at present, and these factors may have uncertain impacts on the development and liquidity of the project. Blockchain technology has become the main target of regulation in various major countries around the world. If the regulatory authorities intervene or exert influence, Musk Dao may be affected, such as legal restrictions on use, which may restrict, hinder, or even terminate the Musk Dao application and development.
 
人才流失风险Risk of Talent Loss：Musk DAO汇聚了一支活力与实力兼备的人才队伍，吸引到了区块链的资深从业者、具有丰富经营的技术开发人员。在今后的发展中，不排除有核心人员离开、团队内部发生冲突而导致Musk DAO整体受到负面影响的可能性。项目技术风险密码学的加速发展或者科技的发展诸如量子计算机的发展，或将破解的风险带给Musk DAO平台，这可能导致Musk DAO的数据丢失。项目更新过程中，可能会出现漏洞，漏洞发现后会及时修复，但不能保证不造成任何影响。目前未可知的其他风险除了本白皮书内提及的风险外，还存在着一些创始团队尚未提及或尚未预料到的风险。此外，其它风险也有可能突然出现，或者以多种已经提及的风险的组合的方式出现。请参与者在做出参与决策之前，充分了解团队背景，知晓项目整体框架与思路，理性参与。
Musk Dao has gathered a team of talented and experienced individuals in the blockchain industry, including senior practitioners and developers with rich technical expertise. However, there is a risk of key personnel leaving or internal conflicts within the team that may have a negative impact on Musk Dao's overall performance in the future. There is also a risk of technology failure as cryptography advances or new technologies, such as quantum computers, may pose a risk of data loss for the Musk Dao platform. During the project update process, there may be vulnerabilities that are discovered and fixed in a timely manner, but it cannot be guaranteed that they will not cause any impact. In addition, there may be other risks that the founding team has not mentioned or anticipated. Therefore, participants should fully understand the team's background and the overall framework and concept of the project before making any investment decisions and participate rationally.
 
竞争风险competition risk：当前区块链领域项目众多，竞争十分激烈，存在较强的市场竞争和项目运营压力。Musk DAO项目是否能在诸多优秀项目中突围，受到广泛认可，既与自身团队能力、战略规划等方面挂钩，也受到市场上诸多竞争者的影响，存在面临恶性竞争的可能。
In the current blockchain field, there are many projects, and the competition is very fierce, which brings strong market competition and project operation pressure. Whether the Musk DAO project can stand out among many excellent projects, gain widespread recognition, depends not only on its own team's abilities and strategic planning, but also on the influence of many competitors in the market, and there is a possibility of facing malicious competition.
